## Running the app

Just clone this repo and install required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```
# yarn 
```

And launch the app using:

```
# yarn run start
```

## Dependencies

Thanks to the awesome npm community, I've used several libraries in this learning project:

* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): HTTP client. I chose this library because it returns directly a parsed JSON object as the response.
* [react-native-elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements): Some extra goodies, like Lists, and other handy elements.
* [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation): Nice library to help with navigation solution based applications.
* [javascript-time-ago](https://github.com/catamphetamine/javascript-time-ago): To help with formatting dates relatively.

## Approach



## TODO

- Use an ORM, like Realm.

## Contributing

I made this project only for learning purposes, so if you have any comments or want to help me with any improvements, you'll be very welcome.
